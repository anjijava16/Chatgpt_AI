# OpenAI

OpenAI stunned the world when it dropped ChatGPT in late 2022. The new generative language model is expected to totally transform entire industries, including media, education, law, and tech. 

In short, ChatGPT threatens to disrupt just about everything. And even before we had time to truly envision a post-ChatGPT world, OpenAI dropped GPT-4.
In recent months, the speed with which groundbreaking large language models have been released is astonishing. If you still don’t understand how ChatGPT differs from GPT-3, let alone GPT-4, I don’t blame you.

In this article, we will cover the key similarities and differences between ChatGPT and GPT-4, including their training methods, performance and capabilities, and limitations.
